 * Cracking the coding interview edition 6
 * Chapter 3 Question 3
 * Stack of Plates: 
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. 
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack 
 * exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. 
 * SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the
 * previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks. push () and SetOfStacks. pop() 
 * should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop ( ) 
 * should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
